# Sort Visualizer
This is a basic sort visualization program built using Python. The basic idea is to help people visualize how sorting algorithms work.

# Usage
If you want to use it, you have to have Python 3.10 installed on your system. I'll try to make executable files in future. Till then, stay tuned. After cloning the repository, open up terminal and run<br> ```pip install pygame```<br>
You need pygame module to use this program.<br><br>
After installing pygame, run the following command:<br>
```python3 main.py``` if you are on Linux, or<br>
```python main.py``` if you are on Windows

P.S.: **DO NOT TAMPER WITH config.txt FILE UNLESS YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF ELSE YOU MIGHT RUN INTO ISSUES**

# Contribution
This is an open source project and anyone can contribute.

# Extras
I am not a hardcore Python dev, so please don't hate me if my code looks stupid :| This program might have some bugs.
